# About Us

Since 1997, G&L Acupuncture and Wellness Center has been dedicated to **helping as many people as possible through the use of natural medicine**. When we opened our first clinic in Beaverton, Oregon we had only one practitioner and two rooms, but we worked hard and dedicated all our energy to helping people as many people as possible. In 2004 we opened our second clinic in West Linn and have been growing ever since.

When we are not treating patients we go into our community to further spread the message of acupuncture and natural healing. We go to health events and wellness fairs all over the city at private companies, community events, and outreach programs. We also do free public seminars about acupuncture and how it can help specific conditions at several local businesses. At all these events we offer short consults, acupuncture demonstrations, and occasionally bring a massage therapist to give free massages!

We are proud to say we have treated thousands of patients, and with that comes an amazing amount of experience. We have treated [chronic pain][0] caused by [car accidents][1] that lasted for over 10 years. Virtually cured [severe allergies][2]that could not be controlled by 5 medications. And stopped extreme [nausea and vomiting][3] that persisted for 6 weeks when no Western doctors could help. It is incredible [what natural medicine can heal][4].
